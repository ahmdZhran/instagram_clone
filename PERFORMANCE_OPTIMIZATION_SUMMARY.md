# Performance Optimization Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. App Initialization Blocking (main.dart)
**Problem**: Multiple heavy operations running simultaneously during app startup
- Firebase initialization
- Dependency injection
- FCM token generation
- Environment variable loading

**Solution**: 
- Separated essential vs non-essential initialization
- Moved FCM and token initialization to background using `Future.microtask()`
- Sequential loading of critical services

### 2. Splash Screen Optimization
**Problem**: 2-second delay and synchronous operations
**Solution**:
- Reduced delay to 1.5 seconds
- Used `Future.microtask()` for navigation logic
- Added frame rate optimization for Lottie animation (30fps)
- Added error handling with fallback

### 3. Settings Loading (Instagram App)
**Problem**: Theme and language loading blocking main thread
**Solution**:
- Moved settings loading to background using `Future.microtask()`
- Fixed async/await issues with void return types

### 4. Home Screen Initialization
**Problem**: Immediate post fetching in `initState()`
**Solution**:
- Used `Future.microtask()` to defer post fetching
- Prevents blocking UI during screen initialization

## Performance Improvements

### Before:
- Multiple heavy operations in `Future.wait()` during app startup
- Synchronous settings loading
- Immediate data fetching in screen initialization
- 2-second splash screen delay

### After:
- Essential services load first, non-essential in background
- All heavy operations moved to background threads
- Reduced splash screen delay
- Deferred data loading to prevent UI blocking

## Key Optimizations Applied

1. **Background Service Initialization**
   ```dart
   void _initializeServicesInBackground() {
     Future.microtask(() async {
       await TokenDeviceManager().initializeToken();
       FCMService.configure();
     });
   }
   ```

2. **Microtask Usage**
   - Used `Future.microtask()` for non-critical operations
   - Prevents main thread blocking
   - Allows UI to render first

3. **Sequential Loading**
   - Critical services load first
   - Non-critical services load in background
   - Better user experience

4. **Error Handling**
   - Added try-catch blocks for background operations
   - Fallback mechanisms for failed operations

## Expected Results

- Reduced skipped frames warnings
- Faster app startup
- Smoother UI transitions
- Better overall performance
- No blocking operations on main thread

## Monitoring

To verify improvements:
1. Check for skipped frame warnings in debug console
2. Monitor app startup time
3. Test UI responsiveness during navigation
4. Verify background operations complete successfully
